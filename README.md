# Hazardous substances in plastics

Extracting tabular data from [Hazardous substances in plastics: Survey of chemical substances in consumer products](http://mst.dk/service/publikationer/publikationsarkiv/2014/dec/hazardous-substances-in-plastics/) (2014) by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency. 

* The PDF document was exported as an Excel spreadsheet by @mdedeo using Acrobat.
* [The IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/akokai/plastic-additives/blob/master/parse-plastic-additives.ipynb) extracts the multiple tables of information describing substances used in plastics as one big table, and exports that to a new Excel spreadsheet. The notebook can be run all at once.
